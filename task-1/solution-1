1. top 5 IP addresses requests come from:

Result:
1184 98.126.83.64
   1 255.75.105.15
   1 255.208.45.156
   1 255.187.137.87
   1 255.158.64.76

Command: cat access.log | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5 

awk '{print $3}' - prints the third column of each line

uniq - removes duplicate lines, but -c tells it to count the occurrences of each unique line instead. 
So, this step counts the number of times each unique appears in the log file.

sort -nr - sorts and reverses the order, showing the most frequent codes first.

head -5: This displays only the first two lines.



2. number of requests with '500' and '200' HTTP codes:

Result: 
There are 0 requests with the 500 Status and 1849 with Status 200.

Commands:
grep ' 500 ' access.log | wc -l
grep ' 200 ' access.log | wc -l

grep: 
wc: This stands for "word count"
-l: This is a flag for wc that tells it to count only the number of lines. 

3. number of requests per minute:

 Result:
 802 04/Oct/2023 15:00
 801 04/Oct/2023 15:01
 778 04/Oct/2023 15:02
 800 04/Oct/2023 15:03
 808 04/Oct/2023 15:04
  11 04/Oct/2023 15:05

Command:
cat access.log | cut -d' ' -f1,2 | cut -d':' -f1,2 | sort | uniq -c

cut: This tool extracts specific fields (columns) from text files based on a delimiter.
-d' ': This specifies the delimiter as a space character ().
-f1,2: This tells cut to extract the first two fields (columns) separated by space
uniq: This tool removes duplicate lines from a sorted file.
-c: This flag tells uniq to count the occurrences of each unique line instead of just removing them

4. which domain is the most requested one?

Result: 2009 example2.com

Command: 
cat access.log | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -2

awk '{print $5}' - prints the fifth column of each line. 

uniq - removes duplicate lines, but -c tells it to count the occurrences of each unique line instead. 
So, this step counts the number of times each unique appears in the log file.

sort -nr - sorts and reverses the order, showing the most frequent codes first.

head -2: This displays only the first two lines.


5. do all the requests to '/page.php' result in '499' code?

Answer: yes

Command:
grep '/page.php' access.log | grep -v ' 499 '

With this command we can check whether there are any /page.php requests that did NOT face 499 error. 
There's no result, which mean that all requests to page.php faced 499 error.



Question:

The fact that one IP address (98.126.83.64) has made a significantly higher number of requests (1184) compared to others is noteworthy. it could be indicative of malicious activities such as scraping, attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, or DoS attack
